Honestly, I don't know if I learned a lot.
Github is hard to navigate and if you want to understand everything there is to know about something you have to view about 15 different pages. (***aka WAY too many***)
This made it pretty difficult to learn, but I tried my best regardless.

Despite this, I did manage to learn a few actual things such as.....
  **1)** I can make text **bold** or in *italics* just by using a few astericks (that's so cool!)
  **2)** Pull requests allow you to propose changes made on a branch and allow others to consider/approve them before you edit the official file (definantly useful)
  **3)** Forks are basically like pull requests but also not at all. You make a fork when you want to contribute to someone else's work as it allows you to play around with the
  code without actually changing anything (that isn't accepted).

  There are also quite a few things I didn't really understand.....
  **1)** I don't know how to make my text different colors. I read the page that told me how but I didn't really get it... Maybe I'll try a video for a better explination.
  **2)** Issues. I understand they're almost like little sticky notes that you'd put on a physical paper project about things you like, problems, potential changes, etc-- but I
  don't get how to make them ):
  **3)** PICTURES. I don't know how to add pictures yet. I want to find out soon.

Thanks for reading. Check out my bio next. It will be awesome (*maybe*).
